    <h1>Diagnosing Revenue Volatility in a Ride-Hailing Platform</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      Product Analyst Case Study
    </p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission publishes trip-level data for
      licensed for-hire vehicles to support regulation and oversight.
      In this case study, the High Volume For-Hire Vehicle dataset is used
      as a proxy to analyze the operations of a large ride-hailing platform
      operating in a dense urban environment.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Business Objective</h2>
    <p>
      From the perspective of a ride-hailing platform, the objective of this
      analysis is to understand the drivers of revenue volatility and identify
      high-impact levers to improve revenue performance while maintaining
      reliable service during peak demand periods.

    <h2>Key Business Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Is revenue performance driven more by trip volume or revenue per trip?</li>
      <li>Are there specific times of day that disproportionately contribute to revenue?</li>
      <li>Do certain days exhibit abnormal revenue behavior?</li>
      <li>Has revenue meaningfully increased or declined over the course of the month?</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Data & Approach</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Used NYC High Volume For-Hire Vehicle trip data as a proxy for a ride-hailing platform.</li>
      <li>Queried Parquet files directly using DuckDB and SQL.</li>
      <li>Started with exploratory diagnostics to avoid premature assumptions.</li>
      <li>Narrowed analysis to the most impactful drivers for clarity and depth.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Revenue volatility is primarily driven by changes in trip volume rather than fare value.</li>
      <li>Revenue per trip remains relatively stable across most days.</li>
      <li>Late afternoon and evening hours (3 PM–8 PM) account for a large share of total revenue.</li>
      <li>End-of-month dates show abnormal revenue spikes compared to surrounding days.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Stabilize trip volume during peak hours</strong> through targeted driver incentives
        or supply rebalancing to reduce revenue volatility.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plan capacity around predictable peak windows</strong> to capture high-demand
        revenue more consistently.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Exclude abnormal days from baseline trend analysis</strong> to avoid skewed
        performance interpretation.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Limitations & Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      This dataset may not capture trips that were cancelled before pickup,
      which could underestimate the impact of supply constraints. With access
      to cancellation and driver availability data, future analysis could
      further isolate demand-supply mismatches and their revenue impact.
